Chernobog
=====

A blog app using Haskell and Yesod

Chernobog is based on Yann Esposito's Yosog tutorial. My intention is to 
eventually work the idea up into my own blogging solution. 

TODO: 

* Complete styling so that it looks like a blog/resume site. 
* Create admin pages for blog entry.
* Add oath for user authentication. 
* Keep playing with this simple POC for now.
